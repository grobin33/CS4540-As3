			<h2>Welcome to the KSLWatcher!</h2>

			<p>This service will keep an eye on the KSL Classifieds for you and alert you when a new listing of interest appears.</p>

			<h3>Using this system means:</h3></tr>
			<ul>
				<li>More free time -- no longer do you need to visit KSL regularly to 
							check for that unopened BeeGees vinyl record you've been pining after.</li>
				<li>Fewer lost opportunities -- don't lose out to someone who's spending 
							all their time scanning the KSL site while you do real work in the real world.</li>
			</ul>
